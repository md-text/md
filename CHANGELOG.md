## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project infrastructure: build system, specs, linting, continuous integration
  and release builds for Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon).
- Command line: `md [FILE | -]`, with `-` for standard input, `--help` and `--version`.
- The application: a main window (menu bar and status bar, empty for now) with
  three side-by-side panes — Markdown source editor, rendered viewer and a
  navigable table of contents. A new document opens in the editor, a file in
  the viewer; any combination of panes can be shown (`F2`/`F3`/`F4`), the
  viewer re-renders live as the source is edited, and `Ctrl-S` saves.
- Standard input is streamed into the viewer as it arrives, following the tail
  (`md -`, or `cmd | md`), with keyboard input taken from the terminal.
- Status bar: the document's name (or a passing notice), the caret position
  while editing or the reading position (`Top`, `Bot`, a percentage, `All`)
  while viewing, line and word counts, encoding and line endings, the modified
  flag, and two toggles: `INS`/`OVR` for the editor's overwrite mode (also the
  `Insert` key) and a mouse field — `🖱=` on terminals known to render the
  icon, `M=` elsewhere — cycling the mouse modes `a`, `n`, `i` and off, after
  vi's `set mouse=` (also `F5`).
- Menu bar: File (Save, Save As…, Quit), View (which panes are shown) and
  Options (overwrite mode, and the mouse mode as a radio submenu), with
  `Alt` + letter mnemonics.
- `Space` pages forward and `Enter` moves down a line in the viewer, as in a
  pager.
- Save As: a vi-style prompt in place of the status bar, the current name
  filled in, with file-name completion and history. `Ctrl-S` on a document
  without a name asks the same way.
- View → Follow cursor: the editor's and the viewer's cursors follow each
  other — a move in the pane you are in puts the other pane's cursor on the
  corresponding place, scrolled to the same row of its pane. Matched by
  source line, so inside formatted text the spot is approximate.
- View → Highlight line: tints the cursor's row in each pane; with Follow
  cursor on, the two tinted rows show the same place in the document.

### Fixed

- Quitting with the viewer focused and the outline shown no longer crashes
  and wedges the process: tearing the panes down rewound focus from the
  viewer to the outline, whose focus-in refreshed the status bar, which asked
  the already-detached viewer for its geometry. The status bar now stops
  refreshing once a pane has left the widget tree. (Crysterm itself now
  survives such teardown errors, restoring the terminal and reporting them.)
- An error that escapes one of md's handlers no longer takes the app down
  with unsaved text: md shows "Internal error: …" in the status bar and goes
  on, with the backtrace in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/md/md.log`
  (`~/.cache/md/md.log`, or `CRYSTERM_LOG_FILE`), where Crysterm's log now
  goes while md runs. An error md cannot continue from is printed with its
  backtrace on the restored terminal, and md exits with status 1.

- The viewer follows the CSS theme/stylesheet (`--colors-theme`,
  `--colors-stylesheet`) like the editor and the table of contents do: its
  background and text take the stylesheet's colors, and its headings, code,
  links, quote bars and rules take the theme's `TextEdit::heading`/`::code`/
  `::link`/`::quote`/`::rule` colors, which a stylesheet can override. (Fixed
  in Crysterm, which md builds against.)
